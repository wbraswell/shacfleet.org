ShinyCMS - Developer Notes
==========================

Some things to bear in mind if you are going to be hacking on ShinyCMS and 
contributing your changes back to the main project.


DATABASE CHANGES

Please do not hand-edit the ShinyCMS::Schema::Result::* modules.  They are 
generated using the bin/regenerate-db-modules script.  If you want to make 
changes to the database structure, make your changes using the tools supplied 
by your database provider (e.g. alter tables or insert new tables using the 
mysql command line interface) and then regenerate the modules using the 
supplied script.


GENERAL

If you remove functionality that other people are using, your changes are 
unlikely to be integrated back into the main project!  It's usually a good 
idea to speak to other users and developers on #shinycms on irc.freenode.net 
before you start making major changes to existing code.
