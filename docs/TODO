ShinyCMS TODO
=============

An incomplete list of features and functionality that we'd like to add to 
ShinyCMS in the future (short or long term).

[ Key: * is (more or less) working, + isn't finished, - isn't started ]


* Top-level / site-wide features
	- Rewrite tasks to read config and access db model directly rather than 
		loading the whole Catalyst app into memory
	+ Redo existing pagination to use Data::Page instead
		+ (Shop already has this, Blog/News/etc need it)
	+ Improve error-handling (coverage and UX)
		- Catch 500 error when admin adds user with duplicate username
		- Catch 500 error when admin adds page with duplicate url_name
	- Refactor larger controllers into sub-controllers (e.g. Shop::Item)
	- Refactor CmsPage, ShopItem (etc?) to inherit from a BaseObject ?? 
		(which has BaseObjectElements)
	- Clearer, more consistent and more robust handling of show/hide for content
		(Currently, blog posts have future-dating, pages have menu_setting, etc)
	+ Nicer test data for blog posts, news items, pages, etc
		+ Use excerpts from Little Brother (CC-licensed)
			- Check to see if anyone has created in-universe websites we can use
	- Background task to delete stale registration/reconnect codes (etc?)
	- Add config options to enable/disable each top-level feature
		- Use that to turn on/off menu items
	- Better handling of user-uploaded images (profile pics, event logos, etc)
	* HTML filtering for user-submitted content
		- Per-site configuration of allowed tag+attribute list
	- Move back-end menus into controller template folders?
		- Automatically find and render admin menus for each controller
			- Need some way to configure order
	* Search
		+ Add search method to each controller, combine results
			+ Build links in controllers, not in template
			- Automatically find and call search method for each controller
		- Move search methods into model rather than controller?
	* Tags
		+ For all resources - news item, gallery image, shop product, etc
	- Ensure graceful degradation anywhere JavaScript is used
		- jQuery date-pickers
		- WYSIWYG editor
	- Look at ways to make Model fatter and Controllers thinner
	- Support for multiple sites from one instance

* CMS Pages
	- Better handling of sections - current compulsory 2-level URLs are non-ideal
	- Access-controlled sections/pages (intranet / members-only areas)
	- Better interface for setting section and page order
		- Multiple-select widget with up/down buttons?  Drag n drop?
	- Handle page template changes - add any extra elements needed
	- Allow page admin to delete page elements
	- Allow template admin to edit template element names
	- Allow template/page admins to edit element order
	- Per-section and/or per-page edit/admin ACLs
	- Full reversion history for page edits
	- Clone page
	- Clone template
	- Configurable redirects?  ( /pages/is/old => /pages/is/new )
	- Screenshot of page layout on edit page, changing with template selection
	- For page add/edit, it would be nice to read in the page-element names 
		and types from the template instead of from the database
	- Change HTML editor to NicEdit ?

	- Monitor for repeated login or reconnect failures, might be an attack
		- Block access to that IP address?
			- Admin interface to view/add/remove IP bans
	- Extend and refine role system into ACL system
